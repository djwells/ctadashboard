# CTA Dashboard - BETA

The CTA Dashboard is a web application that displays a condensed HTML
dashboard of CTA train arrival times.  The application uses the CTA Train
Tracker API to retrieve the data for display.

__THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT__

This software is an independant project and is not affiliated with the City of
Chicago or the CTA.

## Design Philosophy

The goal of the CTA Dashboard project is to generate an HTML dashboard for 
train arrivals in your area.  You can configure the dashboard with whatever 
train lines and stations you want to display.  Train arrivals are displayed in
an information-dense but readable format with multiple train lines and
stations shown on the same screen - similar to what you might see in an
airport arrivals kiosk.
